Hospital Management Analysis

## Project Aim
This project aims to improve operational efficiency at Hospital X by examining appointment patterns, with a focus on understanding attendance rates and identifying the proportion of no-show patients. Understanding the reasons behind no-shows, after analyzing appointment attendance patterns, is key to designing effective strategies to reduce missed appointments and improve scheduling efficiency. Additionally, this project includes a time-based analysis to identify the busiest hours and days for appointments. The goal is to inform strategies that distribute workload more evenly and prevent appointment clustering, ultimately improving operational flow and patient experience. Lastly, the project includes a revenue-based analysis that highlights trends in paid, pending, and failed payments. This analysis is used to identify which treatment types and hospital branches are most associated with failed payments, providing valuable insights to support strategic planning aimed at reducing or eliminating payment failures.
